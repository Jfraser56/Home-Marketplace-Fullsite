# SellYourPlace - Real Estate website

## Create user accounts, list fake properties, and browse other user's fake real estate listings with this web app. Built with ReactJS, Firebase, TailwindCSS, and the Google Cloud Platform.

### Features
* Create, delete, and make changes to your own user account. Every user is able to edit information such as their profile picture, username, and email/password information. 
* Browse listings on an interactive map, or by searching a location. 
* Filter listings based on if they are "For Rent", "For Sale", or both.
* Users are able to "Save" listings they like for easy access later on.
* Users can also list their own fake properties on the Sell page - these listings will then be available to view on the map, or by search to everyone who accesses the site. 
* SellYourPlace uses a combination of the Google Geocoding API and geohashing to pinpoint the location of listings on the map, and query those listings as the user drags the map around

### Features to Implement
* The Explore, Offers, and About pages
* Filter searches based on price
* The markers on the map should be linked to the listing so users can open the listing by interacting with the marker
* The ability to save a search
* The contact form at the bottom of the listing page - will be done using Netlify Forms
* Add "Edit Listings" functionality in the "Manage Listings" tab
* Add pagination to the listings when a user is browsing
* Add a more polished mobile version of the site

Use `npm install` to download all SellYourPlace dependencies, however the API keys are not included, therefore I reccomend just viewing the live app demo.
