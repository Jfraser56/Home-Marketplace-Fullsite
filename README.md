# Home-Marketplace-Fullsite

A "full-stack" ReactJS, Firebase, and TailwindCSS web app that utilizes the firebase API, and Google Cloud Platform
This project allows users to create, delete, and edit their account information such as profile icons, username, and email/password. They may also browse fake home/apartment listings anywhere in the U.S. in real time, as well as post their own listings, and reach out to sellers.

This is still a work in progress, as there are still a few features that need to be implemented, the most obvious being responsive functionality on some of the main pages. Along with this, pages such as the Explore, Offers, and About pages need to be finished as well as the contact form under each individual listing, and a few other other UI/UX components.
