# Home-Marketplace-Fullsite

A full-stack ReactJS, and Firebase web app that utilizes the firebase API, and Google Cloud Platform
This project allows users to create and delete their accounts, browse homes anywhere in the U.S. in real time, as well as post their own listings, and reach out to sellers.

This is still a work in progress, as there are still a few features that need to be implemented such as the Explore, Offers, and About pages, as well as the contact form under each individual listing.
